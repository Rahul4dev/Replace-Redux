  - [Redering without Redux](https://github.com/Rahul4dev/Replace-Redux/tree/rendering_without_redux) 
  - [Using Context API](https://github.com/Rahul4dev/Replace-Redux/tree/ContextAPI) to manage the state via context. However, it is limited in its use cases.
  - [Using Custom Hook](https://github.com/Rahul4dev/Replace-Redux/tree/Redux-Replaced) and React.memo to optimize the app to fix the issue of multiple rendering of components.
  - [Adding More State Slice](https://github.com/Rahul4dev/Replace-Redux/tree/MultipleSclices), here we have added another state slice which is a counter and this counter also can be managed in different components and pages.
